Round robin scheduling is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that is widely used in operating systems. It is designed to fairly allocate CPU time among multiple processes. Here's how it works, step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize a ready queue to hold processes that are ready to execute.
   - Assign a fixed time quantum (also known as time slice or time slot) to each process. This quantum determines the maximum amount of CPU time a process can have before being preempted.

2. **Process Arrival**:
   - When a process arrives, it is added to the end of the ready queue.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The scheduler selects the process at the front of the ready queue to execute on the CPU.
   - The selected process is allowed to execute for the duration of its time quantum or until it voluntarily yields the CPU (e.g., by performing I/O operations).

4. **Preemption**:
   - If a process does not finish executing within its time quantum, it is preempted. Preemption involves suspending the currently running process and moving it to the back of the ready queue, making way for the next process to execute.

5. **Context Switch**:
   - When a process is preempted or completes its execution, a context switch occurs. This involves saving the current state of the running process (such as its program counter and register values) and loading the state of the next process to execute from the ready queue.

6. **Repeat**:
   - Steps 3 to 5 are repeated continuously as long as there are processes in the ready queue.

7. **Completion**:
   - When all processes have completed their execution, the scheduler terminates.

Key Characteristics of Round Robin Scheduling:

- **Fairness**: Round robin scheduling ensures fairness by giving each process an equal share of CPU time. Since processes are executed in a cyclic manner, no single process monopolizes the CPU for an extended period.
  
- **Preemptive**: Round robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm, meaning that the CPU can be taken away from a process before it completes its execution if its time quantum expires.

- **Responsive**: Round robin provides quick response times to interactive processes since each process gets to execute for a small amount of time before being preempted, allowing other processes to also make progress.

- **Overhead**: The overhead of context switching is inherent in round robin scheduling, as processes are frequently switched in and out of the CPU.

- **Performance**: The performance of round robin scheduling can vary based on the choice of time quantum. A shorter time quantum can reduce response time but increase overhead due to frequent context switches, while a longer time quantum can decrease overhead but may lead to poorer responsiveness for interactive tasks.
